He wears red gloves that go 3/4 up his forearms, as well as red boots that go up 3/4 of his shins.

He wears tai chi slippers for footwear. As time goes on and he battles stronger opponents, Garou\\'s appearance changes and he becomes more and more monster-like. After suffering a second defeat at the hands of Saitama, he removes his shirt and wraps his upper body in bandages as he tries to recover. After fighting Death Gatling and the other heroes, his right eye becomes red and bloodshot, and during the consecutive battle with Genos he rubs his own blood into his hair and it becomes red in color.[10] Next he is given a tight long-sleeved black shirt and tight black martial arts pants by the Monster Association,[11] which begin to stick to the blood on his body and merge with his skin as he becomes a \"half-monster\" after his fight with Royal Ripper and Bug God. He also retains a large diagonal scar across his face that was inflicted by Royal Ripper. Later, after enduring several blasts from Overgrown Rover, his clothes become extremely torn and two strands of fabric flow in the wind behind him like scarves,[12] and after being defeated by Orochi his entire body is black with soot and ash.',\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: \"genos\",\r\n    name: \"Genos\",\r\n    photoUrl: Genos,\r\n    photoWidth: 720,\r\n    photoHeight: 406,\r\n    quote: \"Demon Cyborg\",\r\n    description:\r\n      \"Genos is an extremely serious character.

On most occasions, Genos acts as a comic foil to Saitama's clueless antics, using a variety of special techniques, battle tactics and robotic upgrades to combat villains (and sustaining terrible damage in the process), only to be outclassed by Saitama with a single punch.

Unlike most other heroes in the series, Bang prefers to be called by his name rather than his hero alias, Silver Fang. Bang is also well-grounded in the ethics of heroism; he accuses the other S-Class heroes of being heartless for ignoring the disaster in Z-City and attending to their problems instead. Additionally, when witnessing Tanktop Black Hole accuse Saitama of causing the civilians' misery, Bang watches from a distance sympathetically, but without interruption, noting that heroes have to take responsibility for their actions, and will normally have to deal with the lack of appreciation for their work. Later, when his disciple Charanko confronts Saitama by praising his martial arts master's skill and hero rank, Bang angrily scolds his disciple not to embarrass him and states outright that Saitama is many times stronger than he is.\",\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: \"metalknight\",\r\n    name: \"Metal Knight\",\r\n    photoUrl: MetalKnight,\r\n    photoWidth: 1280,\r\n    photoHeight: 720,\r\n    quote: \"Dr. Bofoi\",\r\n    description:\r\n      \"Bofoi has white hair and a large nose.
