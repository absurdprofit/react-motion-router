      "Saitama is usually deliberately drawn in a simpler style than all the other characters, with an elliptical-shaped head and only a basic mouth and eyes. When drawn in a more serious style with more detail, Saitama is revealed to have sharp features, fearsome eyes, and chiseled musculature. Even his posture undergoes a metamorphosis, with a slack posture and sloping elbows when lax, while possessing a straightened posture and squared shoulders when serious. His costume is a plain yellow one-piece jumpsuit with a short zipper at the collar, along with a black belt with a round golden buckle at the center. He wears red gloves that go 3/4 up his forearms, as well as red boots that go up 3/4 of his shins. His costume is finished off by a white cape, which is secured to his shoulders with black circular fasteners.",

      'Garou is a young man with sharp features, yellow eyes, and long silver hair that spikes upwards in two large prongs, giving a feeling of a young wolf.[8][9] While not being a particularly large person, he is shown to be quite muscular. He wears a tight black long-sleeved shirt and loose fitting white martial arts pants, similar to his former master Bang, with a yellow belt wrapped around his waist. He wears tai chi slippers for footwear. As time goes on and he battles stronger opponents, Garou\'s appearance changes and he becomes more and more monster-like. After suffering a second defeat at the hands of Saitama, he removes his shirt and wraps his upper body in bandages as he tries to recover. After fighting Death Gatling and the other heroes, his right eye becomes red and bloodshot, and during the consecutive battle with Genos he rubs his own blood into his hair and it becomes red in color.[10] Next he is given a tight long-sleeved black shirt and tight black martial arts pants by the Monster Association,[11] which begin to stick to the blood on his body and merge with his skin as he becomes a "half-monster" after his fight with Royal Ripper and Bug God. He also retains a large diagonal scar across his face that was inflicted by Royal Ripper. Later, after enduring several blasts from Overgrown Rover, his clothes become extremely torn and two strands of fabric flow in the wind behind him like scarves,[12] and after being defeated by Orochi his entire body is black with soot and ash.',

      "Genos is an extremely serious character. He constantly strives to become stronger and pesters Saitama to train him frequently. Since becoming Saitama's disciple, Genos is very reverent and protective towards his \"teacher\", whom to an extent he envies, although he does express annoyance and disbelief at the mundane training regimen Saitama used to gain his powers. On most occasions, Genos acts as a comic foil to Saitama's clueless antics, using a variety of special techniques, battle tactics and robotic upgrades to combat villains (and sustaining terrible damage in the process), only to be outclassed by Saitama with a single punch. Due to Saitama's incredible strength, Genos is led to believe that there is a secret to Saitama's power.",

      "Bang has a serious personality. His normal demeanor is very calm, shown when he is seemingly unafraid of the dragon-level meteor falling on Z-City. Unlike most other heroes in the series, Bang prefers to be called by his name rather than his hero alias, Silver Fang. Bang is also well-grounded in the ethics of heroism; he accuses the other S-Class heroes of being heartless for ignoring the disaster in Z-City and attending to their problems instead. Additionally, when witnessing Tanktop Black Hole accuse Saitama of causing the civilians' misery, Bang watches from a distance sympathetically, but without interruption, noting that heroes have to take responsibility for their actions, and will normally have to deal with the lack of appreciation for their work. Later, when his disciple Charanko confronts Saitama by praising his martial arts master's skill and hero rank, Bang angrily scolds his disciple not to embarrass him and states outright that Saitama is many times stronger than he is.",
